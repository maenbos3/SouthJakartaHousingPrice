# Predicting South Jakarta Housing Price Using Random Forest Regressor

In this machine learning model, I will illustrate on how to implement Random Forest Regressor to predict housing prices in South Jakarta. The dataset I used in this machine learning model was obtained from Kaggle. The data was collected from various housing websites in Indonesia such as rumah123.com

The dataset contains 6 columns:

HARGA :the price of the house

LT : the land size

LB : the building size

JKT : the number of bedroom(s)

JKM : the number of bathroom(s)

GRS : is there any garage?

KOTA : the name of the city
